# ND - Would you rather... app

This is a project for the React & Redux part of the the React Nanodegree program.
This app allows to answer to polls, each one with two options. You can also create
new poll, view the results, view the ranking by users.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need to have node installed in your workstation.
You can get it here: https://nodejs.org/

If you're workign on osx with homebrew, just run:
```
brew install node
```

### Installing

The installation is straightforward:

```
git checkout
cd
yarn install
yarn start
```

If you want ot use npm instead of yarn, the same steps:

```
git checkout
cd
npm install
npm start
```

## Running the tests

The test should be run with yarn/npm test

### Break down into end to end tests

Up to now, there isn't any test implemented.

```
yarn test
```

### And coding style tests

No coding style tests, just the linter coming from create-react-app.
For coding style, we follow the udacity guides:

serve it with an http server.

```
yarn build
```
